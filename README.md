#MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM

##HISTORY OF MY PROJECT

That was my first CRUD system which i created using only python language. It was the language that i started to learn programming and, since the first time, was amazing understand how it works and how easy is the adaptation by the syntaxes and the commands. The lib is amazing and I’m completely in love for this language hahahaha. So, nowadays I study other languages cause is mandatory to be a professional complete, in other hand surely I’ll focus again in this language and I go deep in the python world. So, this project is really simple but represents a lot to me, someone who started and keep learning day by day, alone but with a lot of hangry of knowledge and a sincerely wish to work with what I love, programming! 

##HOW IT WORKS

At first, this project has three documents, the registry_consult.py is the main program; thus, the cadastro.py is the archive where I developed all the function that is used in the main program, I did it in order to make the main program more clear, easier to read and to update; the last one is the cadastrados.txt where save name and age of the people.

PS: if you don’t have the last doc don’t worry, the first thing the program does is verify if exists de doc, if not a new one is created to receive the information.

The main program starts with a   quick menu function where I can add, modify or delete any option easily just changing the parameters. If the user write anything that’s not a number or out of the interval an error message show up and the user must to choose a valid option to continue.

To add a new person in the text doc you put the name, the age and in the and the program confirm the data and ask for the user sure, if the users write anything which is not Yes or No, so the system show an error message and give the new chance to answer correctly. If the user confirms, the person is add to the list, else and finally the program ask if the user wants to keep in the new members page or to go back to the menu (with the same simple answers validation).

The other option is consult all the members, which shows all the people in the document.txt in order with a cod for each. It was ordered by a function using FOR and WHILE. 

Also is possible to see an specific member, if a choose the third option I can answer with the cod of the person and see the information individually, in the and I can keep in this page and continue the research or go back to the menu. 

In the end there is an option to exit to the program. All the codes you can see in this repository, I’ll be glad you give me some advices or quick tips to improve it or how to do better.
